Fetch & Instruction

The current instruction is stored here. In addition if the next
instruction has been fetched before it is needed (which usually occurs
during load/store instructions) it is stored here in its own register
(F) till needed. During exception processing the TRAP instruction is
generated here and inserted directly into the instruction register.

Also the read data arrives here and is passed onwards in two forms, zero
extended, and combined with a previously read byte held in H to form a
16 bit value.
