ALU Control

This module generates the control signals for the ALU module. To do this
it uses information from the decoder modules together with current
state, the current status and the H register (for SHIFT and BIT) to work
out what needs to be done this cycle. It also generates the sequence of
values required for the SQRT algorithm.
