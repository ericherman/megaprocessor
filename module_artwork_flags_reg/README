Status Register

The status register is a collection of bits that record various aspects
of the results of previous calculations. Whilst PS is internally a 16
bit register only 8 bit are visible to the user, the other hidden 8 bits
are used during complex operations such as multiplication etc. and do
not convey any information from one instruction to the next.
