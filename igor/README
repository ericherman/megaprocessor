IGOR

This consists of an FPGA development board from Lattice piggybacking on
a board that provides 3 to 5V level translation to allow it to talk to
the Megaprocessor. I was originally only going to build one of these but
I ended up splitting out its functions (control, memory, peripherals) to
try and make it easier to see what was happening rather than just having
one board doing magic.
He's described in more detail here.
