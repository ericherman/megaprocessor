Decode B

This bundles together signals from the Opcode Decode module for routing
to other modules. In particular the Status Flags Calculation, ALU
Control and Rnx Control modules. As well as routing it also generates
some signals required by both those modules to begin the task of working
out what needs to be done this cycle.
