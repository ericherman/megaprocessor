Special Purpose Registers

This is where the processor registers Stack Pointer (SP), Program
Counter (PC) and Helper (H) registers are. In addition the registers
driving the external address bus and write data are here. Most of the
functionality is just multiplexing but there is also an adder provided
to allow the H register count out the number of iterations required for
iterative instructions.
