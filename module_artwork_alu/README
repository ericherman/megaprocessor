ALU

This is where the arithmetic and logical operations are carried out. It
splits into two parts ALU1 and ADDER2. Each have two inputs, X and Y.

ADDER2 is much the simpler consisting only of a 16 bit adder/subtractor.

ALU1 has several computational units, a 16 bit adder/subtractor, 16 bit
logic, left and right shifters, logic for the BIT operations. The result
from only one of these is output. Flags reporting various aspects of the
results (zero, negative, overflow)  are sent to the Status Flags
Calculation module.
