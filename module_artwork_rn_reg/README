Rn Registers

This is where the General Purpose Registers (R0, R1, R2, R3) live. They
can be written to from various places.

Usually at most one register is written to in a cycle. However during
MUL and DIV upto all 4 may be written to in a cycle. In this mode each
register has its own shifter to generate its required new value.
