Test Board

To test the larger scale structures I need a huge amount of I/O out of
the PC so I built an I/O expander. These can be daisy chained (I hope,
not tried it yet) to give me what I need to test the largest modules.
Made a stupid stupid mistake on the pinout for the very simplest chip.
Hence the carbuncle.
